ðŸ‘‹ Hello, world! 

My name is Adria Cabeza, and I'm currently a backend engineer at Datadog where I work on building the Cloud SIEM. I have a passion for distributed systems, databases, cloud security, and AI. Before joining Datadog, I worked as a deep learning engineer at restb.ai, where I trained YOLOs, regressors, and classifiers.

I used to be an insatiable hackathon participant as well and a HackUPC organizer, the largest student hackathon in Europe with over 700 participants.

In my free time, you can find me tinkering with new technologies, experimenting with different programming languages, and reading up on the latest developments in the tech industry.
