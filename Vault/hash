During the Algorithms course we had to do a project to find out copies along a huge set of documents. It was really fun and a cool project, but I did not have enough time to digest properly all the concepts (college life can be hard sometimes :laugh). So I think that now that I have time (I’ve just finished my degree), its time to revisit it and even deepin more into the amazing topic of hashes and similarity functions.
